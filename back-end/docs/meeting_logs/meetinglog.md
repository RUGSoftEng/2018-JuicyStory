might be legal gray area

statistics is a main part.
completions


### private API

too dangerous legally
risk account blocked

public api doesn't have pusing to story

### biggest obstacle / main thing

virtually simulate client environment and push through that

Android emulator?

pictures from direct messages
pictures from hashtags

picture DM metadata through public api 

### first steps

investigate what api needed

get picture from instagram 

put picture in instagram


### technology

suggestions were just for simple learning curve
(php/lavarel)


laravel
laracast

### further



first photo, video later

no photo editing (in main project)


get photos in juicystory and then push it into client instagram account



Statistics is definitely necessary, but much easier probably (there are API's)


Aesthetics is not priority for MVP


two parts: frontend and backend.


### Continuous integration

important: continuous integration (at the end of the block)

automatically test code when pushing

no untested code in develepment

85% code coverage (for a start)



### Cost

ask juicystory company



### this week

look up in the API's
see what we can use
look into virtualization, see what we can do
android/linux/browser environment.

next meeting: have frontend and backend


weekly meeting: doodle on sundays
