- Find out your local ip address (ipconfig on windows, ifconfig on linux. It's the one that goes 192....)

- Forward the port to your local ip address through your router interface (google port forwarding, it's easy)

- Start django server with python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:[PORT]. Use the port that you have forwarded. 8000 works alright. 0.0.0.0 part is important!!

- Add your ip adddress (external ip address. google to find) to the allowed hosts in django settings file.

- Add that ip address also to the redirect urls on instagram api

- Go to [IP]:[PORT] on your browser, should be working.

- Voila! Don't forget to stop routing the port after you are done developing.
